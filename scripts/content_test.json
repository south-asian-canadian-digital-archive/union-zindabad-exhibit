Never has the history of South Asian Canadians and their relationship to the BC labour movement been studied in this manner.</p>\n<p>I am personally grateful to Dr Anushay Malik whose knowledge of South Asian history provided background and context of which we would not otherwise have been aware. Her enthusiasm and expertise have been invaluable.</p>\n<p>Bailey Garden, the BC Labour Heritage Centre\u2019s Project Manager has been relentless in her encouragement, excitement and talent in shaping the exhibit and the accompanying print version.</p>\n<p>Henry John, Kaden Walters, Al Lundgren and John Mountain at the IWA Archives also deserve our appreciation for passionately preserving the union records we were able to draw upon for research. Our thanks also to Craig Berggold for his generosity with the Canadian Farmworkers Union Collection and connecting us with many individuals from that historic period.</p>\n<p>The ground-breaking research conducted for this project has both benefited from and been challenged by the immensity of the task. By necessity, the result of our work over the past year is an overview. We accept these limitations and are satisfied to leave many avenues open for future study and research.</p>\n<p>The stories of working people in British Columbia have historically been overshadowed by traditional colonial and capitalist-centred narratives. Our archives and history texts are rich in praise of the capitalists and owners, while woefully short of stories of the workers whose labour created the province\u2019s wealth.</p>\n<p>We are also painfully aware that the labour movement in BC was a willful participant in early racist attitudes, exclusionary policies and actions. We cannot shy away from this fact.</p>\n<p>History records mistakes as well as triumphs. We acknowledge these and we commit to ensuring these mistakes are not repeated.</p>\n<p>The South Asian Canadian population in BC has a long and complex relationship with the labour movement. From early exclusionary practices to a recognition that racism is a tool of the boss to divide workers, the tenacity and strength of community has always been forward looking. \u00a0As a result, the labour movement has benefited from strong South Asian leaders, activists and members.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Donna Sacuta, Executive Director<img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1709 alignright\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"111\" src=\"../images/preface_img_0.jpg\" srcset=\"\" width=\"300\"/></p>\n<p>February 2022</p>\n<p>ufcw1518</p>\n</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n</div><!-- #post-## -->\n</div>",

In the BC labour movement, cries of <em>\u201cFarmworkers Zindabad!\u201d</em> have been heard at massive protest rallies in recent decades, but the phrase has a history that reaches across the Pacific Ocean. The title of this exhibit encapsulates the spirit of South Asian Canadian labour activism: <em><strong>\u201cLong Live the Union!\u201d</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>This exhibit focuses on the history of South Asian immigrants as workers, and their relationship to the labour movement in BC.</strong> We also explore the evolving attitudes of unions towards South Asian immigrant labour.</p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-25\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_25\" style=\"width: 800px\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-28\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"616\" src=\"../images/introduction_img_0.jpg\" srcset=\"\" width=\"800\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-25\">The vast majority of migrants to Canada in the early 20th Century were Sikhs from India\u2019s Punjab region, and most came to British Columbia. Hindus and Muslim were also represented, and the term \u201cHindu\u201d became widely used to incorrectly describe all South Asians. <i>Hastings Street Vancouver 1905, </i>City of Vancouver Archives, Port P1551.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-25\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_25\" style=\"width: 300px\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24 size-medium\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"245\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"../images/introduction_img_1.jpg\" srcset=\"\" width=\"300\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-25\">Immigration Branch Records, reprinted in Sarjit Singh, \u201c<em>An oral history of the Sikhs in British Columbia\u201d</em>\u00a0 (Thesis, UBC, 1991), 136<em>. </em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The three main reasons behind the large increase in South Asian immigration to BC between 1900 and 1910 were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li>To find work and build a better life in Canada</li>\n<li>To escape persecution in India</li>\n<li>To help build support for anti-colonial networks outside of India</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"no-indent\">Racism was rampant in Canada\u2019s white colonial society in this time period. Union attitudes in BC were no different. Early labour leaders successfully encouraged federal and provincial governments to invoke discriminatory laws and regulations that limited South Asians\u2019 migration and ability to work in safe and well-paid jobs.</p>\n<p>However, three historic events can be said to be watershed moments when new alliances were formed between BC labour and South Asian workers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>World War Two</li>\n<li>New waves of South Asian immigration in the 1960s and 70s</li>\n<li>Organization of farmworkers in the 1980s</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles, the South Asian community drew on its own radical histories and found allies in the labour movement. British Columbia unions in turn benefited from the skills and dedication that South Asian members brought to the movement: a commitment to collective action, unity of purpose and devotion to fellow workers.</p>\n<p>Over time, South Asian Canadians claimed power in their own unions, inspiring involvement in politics and government. The journey has not been easy. Through over of 100 years of courage, struggle, determination and loyalty the South Asian community in British Columbia has persisted and asserted its place in BC\u2019s labour movement.</p>\n<p><em>*</em>We have chosen to use the term <em>South Asian</em> as a broadly inclusive term, unless quoted in another manner.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"288\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"../images/introduction_img_2.jpg\" srcset=\"\" width=\"800\"/></p>\n<div>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n</div><!-- #post-## -->\n</div>",

I agreed with him that I\u2019ll be ready to work with them for the IWA.

Most of the Indian and Chinese will get much less for the same work. And this was my experience where I found an Indian working for 25 cents an hour or 30 cents an hour, while other workers getting the full 40 cents.<strong> Invariably East Indians were the first to be fired and last to be hired. So furthermore, I found that only rarely was there an East Indian who would get any skilled job.</strong> They would mostly get jobs in the yard. Jobs loading the box cars and jobs on the green chain. The toughest jobs there. Now this had to do with the general situation as it prevailed in the British Columbia community. Racial discrimination was stark. In the first phase they were terribly afraid. Many many people would come over to me. They would say, \u2018you are wasting your time\u2019, that this way you will become a marked man. That the bosses will get me out of the industry, that I\u2019ll ruin my chances of having any secure life.\u201d<a aria-label=\"Footnote 2\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#footnote-116-2\" id=\"return-footnote-116-2\" title=\"Perry and Pritchett (1979), 53-54.\"><sup class=\"footnote\">[2]</sup></a></span></p>\n<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]--><br/>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" id=\"audio-116-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\"><source src=\"https://pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/4310/2021/10/Harinder-as-Darshan-Darshan-chapter-quote-1.mp3?_=1\" type=\"audio/mpeg\"/><a href=\"https://pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/4310/2021/10/Harinder-as-Darshan-Darshan-chapter-quote-1.mp3\">https://pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/4310/2021/10/Harinder-as-Darshan-Darshan-chapter-quote-1.mp3</a></audio></p>\n</div>\n<p><a aria-label=\"Footnote 3\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#footnote-116-3\" id=\"return-footnote-116-3\" title=\"Harinder Mahil.

Political expedience required reform. Labour\u2019s decades long demand for federal unemployment insurance was realized in 1940. Universal family allowances were introduced in 1944. <strong>And at long last, after seventy years of struggle, the fight for compulsory recognition of unions and collective bargaining was finally won, first in British Columbia and then across Canada.</strong> In 1943, amendments to BC\u2019s flawed Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act gave the government authority to recognize a union and force employers to bargain.<a aria-label=\"Footnote 1\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#footnote-112-1\" id=\"return-footnote-112-1\" title=\"Mickleburgh, On the Line, 106.\"><sup class=\"footnote\">[1]</sup></a></p>\n<p><strong>At the start of World War II the dominant union for lumber workers in BC was the</strong> <strong>International Woodworkers of America (IWA)</strong>. A disastrous strike in 1938 drained the IWA\u2019s resources and its membership numbered just a few hundred. It had no contracts in place and the future seemed bleak.</p>\n<p><strong>As a strategy to revive the union, the IWA leadership embraced new organizing strategies to encourage membership and involvement from South Asians, and other ethnic workers</strong>. The fight against fascism created a wartime labour shortage, and the willingness of government to concede union recognition meant organizing took off. South Asian Canadians, reluctant to join the war effort while still denied the vote, were still a significant part of the sawmill workforce.</p>\n<p><strong>In early December 1943, District Council No. 1 of the IWA signed its first coast-wide forest agreement, a one-year deal covering eight thousand employees in twenty-three camps and mills.</strong> The agreement recognized the IWA as the bargaining agent for the workers, <strong>ending the reign of labour contractors</strong>. Through this successful collective agreement, the union achieved an 8-hour day and 48-hour week as well as seniority provisions that guaranteed equality of treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>By the end of 1946 the IWA was the third-largest union in Canada with more than 25,000 members.</strong> Thousands of South Asians were already employed in the lumber industry. .</p>\n<p><strong>These first agreements were also the death knell of discriminatory, racially based wages in sawmills.</strong> This was a major shift;\u00a0 a generation-spanning dedication to the IWA from South Asian lumber workers took root in this period.</p>\n<p>Technological change in the forest industry, which began in the 1970s impacted workers dramatically.

The service economy was growing. Union membership declined among private sector workers but grew in the expanding public sector, which also gained bargaining rights.</p>\n<p><strong>Some of these newly arrived South Asian women had marketable skills and education, </strong>often with English language skills and university-level educations \u2013 they were able to enter fields such as social work, teaching, nursing, office administration and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Still, many women who did not have these advantages </strong>and were limited to low-skilled and low-paid in-service work: in hotel and restaurant kitchens, cleaners and farmworkers.</p>\n<p><strong>Working class women\u2019s entry to the paid labour force was often mediated by their roles as mothers and wives.</strong> On occasion it was the male household members who were IWA union members in sawmills and knew the benefits of belonging to a union who encouraged their spouses to join unions as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Marie Decaire</strong>, former Secretary-Treasurer of Hotel, Restaurant, Culinary Employees and Bartenders Union Local 40, one of the oldest unions in British Columbia (now known as UNITE HERE! Local 40), estimates that <strong>15% of the membership was South Asian when she was on the executive.</strong> This membership represented workers in virtually every form of hospitality, restaurant and service industry throughout British Columbia and the Yukon. She worked alongside <strong>Rishi Sharma</strong>, an executive member originally from Fiji, who was elected chief shop steward by workers at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Vancouver. <strong>Many Local 40 members were women and new immigrants from the wider South Asian diaspora, and were active in the union.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"textbox shaded\">\n<p style=\"line-height: 2.5em\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><span style=\"font-size: larger;\">\u201cI made my way up the narrow, winding road to Lillooet and when I got there, I contacted the shop steward and the shop steward set up a meeting and it turned out the shop steward was indeed Indo-Canadian and Punjabi out of the Punjab originally, although I think probably second generation; and the crew to be organised were indeed the wives, sisters, daughters and so on of Indo-Canadians living in and around the Lillooet area and primarily wanting the protection, wages and benefits that they (male family members) enjoyed in the IWA that were not available to the workers. In any event, I then, of course, went about busily trying to sign check-off cards and all these folk, they were mostly housekeeping kitchen staff and maintenance. And just overall cleaning staff at the hotel.\u201d<br/>\n\u201c\u2026Being in a union, being in the IWA and standing up for your rights was the way of Canadian life for them. And and you know, a lot of them had socialist backgrounds. I mean, there was the socialism that came with them. They were renegades in their own country anyway. And so there was a meshing of philosophy, if you will, between the labour movement and South Asian Canadian workers generally.\u201d</span></span><a aria-label=\"Footnote 1\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#footnote-129-1\" id=\"return-footnote-129-1\" title=\"Marie Decaire, interview by Bailey Garden, September 29, 2021.

He was one of the first professional Bhangra dancers in BC, teaching many Canadian-born youth through his Richmond based dance troupe, the <strong>Punjab Cultural Association</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Bhangra</em> originated as an amalgamation of folk dances from various regions in the Punjab, coming together in the revolutionary era of the 1940s and continuing to evolve in years since. Song lyrics often include themes of love, patriotism, strength and celebration during times of harvest, which resonated strongly with BC farmworkers. Many of the traditional dance moves represent farming activities: for example, the \u201cpick and place\u201d action of harvesting or moving crop.</p>\n<p><strong>The Binning family was involved with the CFU from the beginning</strong>, and it wasn\u2019t long before Paul was in charge of organizing entertainment for the union\u2019s frequent fundraising dinners.

It was the year that they were among multiple unions who came together at a San Francisco convention to consider \u201cone big union\u201d for all maritime and waterfront workers.

Jinny Sims, Raj Chouhan, Harry Bains and Moe Sihota are just four of the examples of prominent South Asians who were pillars of the South Asian Canadian community, and for the first three of them, it was directly their work within the labour movement that helped launch their political careers, thus allowing them to continue to work to build a more progressive, more inclusive BC.</p>\n<p>The problem of racism and exclusion continues into the present day, in workplaces and even within unions.</p>\n<p>The relationship of South Asian Canadians to the labour movement shows that unions can be an important partner to help build solidarities between the diverse working classes of British Columbia for their mutual strength and benefit.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n</div><!-- #post-## -->\n</div>",
