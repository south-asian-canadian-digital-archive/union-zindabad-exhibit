<p>We are honoured to have been entrusted by the South Asian Studies Institute to undertake this research. Never has the history of South Asian Canadians and their relationship to the BC labour movement been studied in this manner.</p>
<p>I am personally grateful to Dr Anushay Malik whose knowledge of South Asian history provided background and context of which we would not otherwise have been aware. Her enthusiasm and expertise have been invaluable.</p>
<p>Bailey Garden, the BC Labour Heritage Centre’s Project Manager has been relentless in her encouragement, excitement and talent in shaping the exhibit and the accompanying print version.</p>
<p>Henry John, Kaden Walters, Al Lundgren and John Mountain at the IWA Archives also deserve our appreciation for passionately preserving the union records we were able to draw upon for research. Our thanks also to Craig Berggold for his generosity with the Canadian Farmworkers Union Collection and connecting us with many individuals from that historic period.</p>
<p>The ground-breaking research conducted for this project has both benefited from and been challenged by the immensity of the task. By necessity, the result of our work over the past year is an overview. We accept these limitations and are satisfied to leave many avenues open for future study and research.</p>
<p>The stories of working people in British Columbia have historically been overshadowed by traditional colonial and capitalist-centred narratives. Our archives and history texts are rich in praise of the capitalists and owners, while woefully short of stories of the workers whose labour created the province’s wealth.</p>
<p>We are also painfully aware that the labour movement in BC was a willful participant in early racist attitudes, exclusionary policies and actions. We cannot shy away from this fact.</p>
<p>History records mistakes as well as triumphs. We acknowledge these and we commit to ensuring these mistakes are not repeated.</p>
<p>The South Asian Canadian population in BC has a long and complex relationship with the labour movement. From early exclusionary practices to a recognition that racism is a tool of the boss to divide workers, the tenacity and strength of community has always been forward looking.  As a result, the labour movement has benefited from strong South Asian leaders, activists and members.</p>

<p>Indigenous people have lived in British Columbia since time immemorial. For much of the nineteenth century, they provided the bulk of wage labour on their ancestral lands to the emerging colonial economy.</p>
<p>Rampant expansion in the province’s rich resource industries – logging, sawmills, fisheries and mines – beginning in the late 1800s a flood of immigrants from around the world displaced indigenous workers.</p>

<h2>Why “Union Zindabad!”?</h2>
<p><strong><em>“Zindabad”</em> </strong>is used as a cheer or exclamation of support in Punjabi, Hindi, Urdu, Odia and Bengali languages, literally translating to <em>“Long live [idea or person]”</em>. In the BC labour movement, cries of <em>“Farmworkers Zindabad!”</em> have been heard at massive protest rallies in recent decades, but the phrase has a history that reaches across the Pacific Ocean. The title of this exhibit encapsulates the spirit of South Asian Canadian labour activism: <em><strong>“Long Live the Union!”</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>This exhibit focuses on the history of South Asian immigrants as workers, and their relationship to the labour movement in BC.</strong> We also explore the evolving attitudes of unions towards South Asian immigrant labour.</p>
<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_25" style="width: 800px"><img alt="" class="wp-image-28" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="616" src="../images/introduction_img_0.jpg" srcset="" width="800"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-25">The vast majority of migrants to Canada in the early 20th Century were Sikhs from India’s Punjab region, and most came to British Columbia. Hindus and Muslim were also represented, and the term “Hindu” became widely used to incorrectly describe all South Asians. <i>Hastings Street Vancouver 1905, </i>City of Vancouver Archives, Port P1551.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The three main reasons behind the large increase in South Asian immigration to BC between 1900 and 1910 were:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>To find work and build a better life in Canada</li>
<li>To escape persecution in India</li>
<li>To help build support for anti-colonial networks outside of India</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="no-indent">Racism was rampant in Canada’s white colonial society in this time period. Union attitudes in BC were no different. Early labour leaders successfully encouraged federal and provincial governments to invoke discriminatory laws and regulations that limited South Asians’ migration and ability to work in safe and well-paid jobs.</p>
<p>However, three historic events can be said to be watershed moments when new alliances were formed between BC labour and South Asian workers:</p>
<ul>
<li>World War Two</li>
<li>New waves of South Asian immigration in the 1960s and 70s</li>
<li>Organization of farmworkers in the 1980s</li>
</ul>
<p>Faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles, the South Asian community drew on its own radical histories and found allies in the labour movement. British Columbia unions in turn benefited from the skills and dedication that South Asian members brought to the movement: a commitment to collective action, unity of purpose and devotion to fellow workers.</p>
<p>Over time, South Asian Canadians claimed power in their own unions, inspiring involvement in politics and government. The journey has not been easy. Through over of 100 years of courage, struggle, determination and loyalty the South Asian community in British Columbia has persisted and asserted its place in BC’s labour movement.</p>
<p><em>*</em>We have chosen to use the term <em>South Asian</em> as a broadly inclusive term, unless quoted in another manner.</p>

<p><strong>On September 7th, 1907 thousands of white citizens rioted through Vancouver’s</strong> <strong>Chinatown,</strong> <strong>destroying homes and businesses</strong>. Windows were smashed, stores looted, and Chinese Canadians were beaten. After venting their fury on Chinatown, the crowd headed to Powell Street to attack Japanese citizens. Chinese and Japanese people were visible symbols of racial hatred, but the mob also had their eye on the rising tide of immigration from India.</p>
<p><strong>In March 1907, British Columbia passed a law to disenfranchise all ‘natives not of Anglo-Saxon parents.’</strong> One month later, South Asians were denied the vote in Vancouver through changes in the Municipality Incorporation Act. This denied them the vote at all levels, including the Federal vote, which used the provincial voter’s list; the fact that India was also a British Crown colony meant nothing. <a aria-label="Footnote 1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-34-1" id="return-footnote-34-1" title='"1907," South Asian Canadian Heritage, accessed November 10, 2021, https://www.southasiancanadianheritage.ca/march-1907/.'><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>South Asian, Chinese and Japanese citizens would be barred from the political process in Canada for the next 40 years,</strong> until 1947 when the vote for South Asian Canadians was reinstated; other communities waited until 1948 and 1949 respectively. Most shameful of all, Indigenous people were denied the right to vote without relinquishing Status in Canada until 1960.</p>
<p>During this later period, the BC labour movement worked against racism and evolved as an effective vehicle for immigrant communities to advocate for their rights, despite unions having led the demands for exclusion in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>The Vancouver Branch of the Asiatic Exclusion League (AEL) was established in August 1907 by organized labour, politicians and other community leaders.</strong> At its founding meeting representatives of similar organizations in Washington State were in attendance. Meetings were held at the Labor Hall and the first executive was dominated by union members.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The object of this organization is to work for the exclusion from the Dominion of Canada, its territory and its possessions, all Asiatics,” said a story in the Vancouver Daily World on August 10, 1907. “The list of signatures was headed by Mayor Bethune, and includes several members of the legal legislature and a member of the Dominion parliament.”</em><a aria-label="Footnote 2" class="footnote" href="#footnote-34-2" id="return-footnote-34-2" title="Vancouver Daily World, August 10, 1907, 7."><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>At its first meeting, the AEL decided to hold a rally at City Hall and a parade through the streets of Vancouver on September 7, 1907</strong>.

<p class="text-viewer text-viewer-paragraph"><strong>Early BC unions were resolutely opposed to non-white immigration and only accepted white members.</strong> Their objections were rooted in racism, but also in past experience.

<p>The notorious BC capitalist Vancouver Island coal baron <strong>James Dunsmuir</strong> held office both as BC’s Premier and Lieutenant Governor. He refused to ban the use of Oriental labour in BC because he routinely used it in his mines.</p>

<p><strong> </strong>For the South Asian community <strong>bunkhouses provided a space for political interaction</strong>. Though most early immigrants were illiterate, those who could would read radical literature in the shared bunkhouses and translate as well.</p>
<p><strong>Ranjit Hall</strong> came to Canada in 1924 with his mother to join his father who was working at Fraser Mills. They were the first South Asian family at Fraser Mills and moved into the “Hindu” bunkhouses. He recalled his early life there:</p>

I don’t remember seeing any Chinese children, but I do remember seeing maybe 2 or 3 Chinese women… We lived right in the mill itself so there was no community. My mother contrived to make sure that I did not wander too far. She said the Chinese people love to eat little boys. This was to make me fearful so I would stay around the house. So I would afraid for a long time until I grew up and realised that this wasn’t so… the people who lived in those bunkhouses: all I saw them doing was working….”</span></span></p>

<p>Until the mid-1950s, British Columbia homes were fueled by wood or coal.</p>
<p><strong>In the 1920s, South Asian Canadians began selling and delivering wood fuels like sawdust and mill-ends to homes and also supplied ‘hog fuel’ to industry. Initially horses powered deliveries; later on it was trucks.</strong></p>

<p>This was innovative niche work. Sellers connected their work in the lumber industry to consumer demand. Wood fuel sellers were stratified by ethnicity and the work became known as a South Asian specialty. Beside being a source of family income, wood fuel sales defined relationships between South Asian sellers and the mainly white buyers.</p>
<p>Bikram (Vic) Berar recalled being asked to help sell wood fuel as a kid on Vancouver Island:</p>

<p><strong>Labour contractors played a major role in the lives of newly arrived immigrants looking for work</strong> – not only South Asians, but also Chinese, Japanese and other groups.</p>
<p>Sometimes workers would be recruited in their home country and sponsored to Canada by the contractor themselves; other times, workers met contractors in Canada, quickly learning that<strong> labour contractors were the true “boss” for minority communities.</strong></p>
<p>Many of the people who came from India in the beginning of the 20th century did not speak English and relied on contractors to connect them to jobs. The system was exploitative; workers were required to give a portion of their wages to the contractor to whom they became indebted.</p>
<p>Joe Miyazawa, an IWA activist hired to organize Japanese sawmill workers, described the so-called “Tyee system” of labour contractors within the lumber industry in an oral history interview featured in Episode 8 of the BC Labour Heritage Centre’s podcast. <a aria-label="Footnote 1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-68-1" id="return-footnote-68-1" title='Rod Mickleburgh, host.

<p><strong>In 1913, on the eve of the First World War, the Ghadar movement was organized on the west coast of the United States and quickly spread to Canada.</strong></p>
<p>Ghadar, a movement dedicated to overthrowing British rule in India and fighting the racist and discriminatory immigration policies of Canada and the United States united Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus inspired by their respective religions and the ideas of Western liberals and socialists.” <a aria-label="Footnote 1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-79-1" id="return-footnote-79-1" title='Peter Campbell, "East Meets Left: South Asian Militants and the Socialist Party of Canada in British Columbia, 1904-1914", Journal of Canadian Studies 20, Fall 1999, 36.'><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a></p>
<p>The movement was broadly supported by South Asians in BC. There were natural links between Ghadar, anti-colonial sentiment, Gurdwaras and later the labour movement in BC. Ghadar was a nationalist, anti-imperialist and anti-racist movement that was global in its scope. It was very strong amongst the diaspora and long after the official Ghadar “party” failed to achieve mutiny in India, Ghadarites continued to exert an influence in global radical politics and their legacy outlived them.<a aria-label="Footnote 2" class="footnote" href="#footnote-79-2" id="return-footnote-79-2" title="See (amongst many others): Maia Ramnath, Haj to Utopia: How the Ghadar Movement Charted Global Radicalism and Attempted to Overthrow the British Empire, University of California Press: 2011, 4-8"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>An important radical labour organization in the early 20th century was the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Founded in Chicago in 1905, the IWW was unique in that they sought to include all races in unions.</strong></p>
<p>No one promoted class struggle more vigorously than the IWW.

<p><strong>Forty-eight year old Husain Rahim arrived in Vancouver in 1910</strong> as a tourist and almost immediately connected with other South Asian activists already in Canada. Rahim quickly attracted the attention of authorities who believed him to be a dangerous radical.</p>
<p>Rahim (who also went by the name <strong>Chagan Khiraj Varma</strong>) was well traveled, spoke four languages and connected South Asian Canadians to Indian revolutionaries across the world. <strong>He forged early ties between South Asian millworkers and the labour movement.</strong></p>
<p>Soon after arriving in BC, Rahim formed the <strong>Canada India Supply Company</strong> which traded in real estate. Most of his clients were Sikh millworkers. He spent time in the town of Paldi on Vancouver Island, one of the first South Asian-owned sawmill communities in BC. Rahim commanded a great deal of respect in the mill town; “he was an educated man and millowner Mayo [Singh] … trusted his advice.” <a aria-label="Footnote 1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-88-1" id="return-footnote-88-1" title="Joan Mayo.Paldi Remembered: 50 Years in the Life of a Vancouver Island Logging Town, Paldi History Committee, 1997, 4."><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>In 1918 in the wake of World War I, working class anger at eroding wages, unemployment and wartime profiteering resulted in high union membership and a determination among labour to forge a radical new path. In March 1919 the BC Federation of Labor abandoned its long demand for Asian exclusion.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>One Big Union (OBU)</strong>, created in 1919, embraced direct action and the use of general strikes to end political repression and win breakthrough measures such as the 8-hour day. Delegates to the 1919 BC Federation of Labour Convention declared “this body recognizes no aliens but the capitalist”.<a aria-label="Footnote 1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-95-1" id="return-footnote-95-1" title="Mickleburgh, On the Line, 65."><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>The OBU’s platform echoed many principles which propelled the IWW to success a decade earlier.</strong> Chief among those was its <strong>anti-racist views</strong> which appealed to South Asian radicals.</p>
<p>OBU activists included people like <strong>Ernest Winch</strong> and <strong>William Pritchard</strong> who had connected with the South Asian community through <strong>Husain Rahim</strong> at the Socialist Party’s <em>Western Clarion</em> newspaper in 1912.</p>

<p>In early 1919, <strong>Ernest Winch</strong> became secretary of the <strong>BC Loggers’ Union</strong>, a new organization dedicated to organizing loggers across BC. Though most South Asians worked in sawmills, not as loggers, the union still made inroads among millworkers. The union soon changed its name to the <strong>Lumber Workers Industrial Unit</strong> of the <strong>One Big Union</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The earliest instance of South Asian workers formally participating in a BC labour dispute led by a union took place at Fraser Mills in 1931</strong>. After their fifth wage cut in 20 months, employees voted to strike September 17, 1931. Demands included less forced overtime, and better working conditions. These millworkers had recently joined the <strong>Lumber Workers Industrial Union.</strong></p>
<p>There were sizeable numbers of Francophone, Japanese, Chinese and South Asian workers (incorrectly referred to as <em>Hindus</em>, even by the union) at Fraser Mills. The leader of the strike was 27-year-old shingle weaver <strong>Harold Pritchett</strong>, who went on to play a significant role in the further growth of lumber unions in Canada and the US.</p>

<p>Skills were bartered among workers to provide basic services such as shoe repairs, hair cuts and supplying firewood. On day three of the strike, machine guns were mounted at the mill gates by police, who kept the strikers under constant surveillance.</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>At a mass strike support meeting in New Westminster, millworker K.

Asian and South Asian workers were hired and fired at will. They had no protection. If they joined the union, they could be blacklisted, he told the large crowd – yet join the union they did. </span><br/>

<p>The <strong>New Westminster Labour Council</strong> passed a motion that “the vermin-infested and unsanitary bunkhouses located in and on the property owned by Canadian Western Lumber Company and rented and occupied by Orientals and Hindus be abolished”. <a aria-label="Footnote 4" class="footnote" href="#footnote-100-4" id="return-footnote-100-4" title='Rod Mickleburgh, host.

<p><strong>After 9 weeks on strike, the union ultimately accepted an offer by the company — which did not address all of the union’s demands.</strong> The Secretary of the Lumber Workers Union summed up these workers achievements in a letter to the Vancouver Sun:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="textbox shaded">
<p style="line-height: 2.5em"><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: larger;">“Instead of the Oriental scabbing on the white man, which has always been the bogey man that the lumber bosses have held over the head of the lumber workers, they have seen Japanese, Chinese and Hindus stand solid with Frenchmen, Swedes and practically every nationality under the sun.”</span></span><a aria-label="Footnote 5" class="footnote" href="#footnote-100-5" id="return-footnote-100-5" title="M. Palmgren, &quot;Workers' Demands&quot;, letter to editor, The Vancouver Sun, Nov 26, 1931, 6."><sup class="footnote">[5]</sup></a></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>After the strike, organizers such as <strong>Harold Pritchett</strong> were blacklisted from employment and struggled to find work through the rest of the Great Depression. Union recognition was a “line in the sand” which industrial employers would not concede until the 1940s, when the federal government finally passed legislation requiring employers to recognize and bargain with unions and unions were required to use grievance procedures instead of striking. Nevertheless, employer coercion persisted.</p>

<p>Union organizing in mills owned by South Asians was challenging. Many of the workers were indebted to those who had given them a job, or sometimes had family or friend connections to the employers which made them hesitant to unionize for fear of being disrespectful.</p>

<p><strong>The New Democratic Party (NDP) founding constitution in 1961 enshrined the inclusion of all races in the party’s membership.</strong> Its political program called for a Canadian Bill of Rights as part of the country’s constitution.</p>
<p>The <strong>International Woodworkers of America (IWA), </strong>which became the predominant union in the forest industry in BC, were formally affiliated to the NDP in BC. As the Party grew, so too did its South Asian membership, many of whom ultimately took political office with the NDP and on the provincial stage.</p>

<p>On May 11 1907<em> The Western Clarion</em> reported that <strong>“Hindu workmen” at a mill in Kaslo BC successfully struck for more wages</strong>.</p>
<p>In February 1909, <strong>100 ‘Hindu’ lumber mill workers went on strike at Fraser Mills because their wages had not been paid to them by a labour contractor. </strong>In this incident, the workers took their case directly to the <strong>New Westminster Police</strong>, demanding they be freed from the contractor who was skimming their pay.</p>
<p><strong>In an unusual twist, the labour contractor in question turned out to be</strong> <strong>Uday Ram</strong> who became President of the Canada India Supply Company run by <strong>Husain Rahim</strong>. <a aria-label="Footnote 1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-92-1" id="return-footnote-92-1" title='"Document Disappeared", The Daily Province, March 7, 1912, 40 and "Suit Between Hindus", The Daily Province, September 25, 1912, 20.'><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a></p>

<p>Prior to 1912 many unions came and went in sawmills and logging operations up and down the west coast but they had little interest in the poorly paid immigrant workers who toiled mostly in the mills. Most of these unions were small, unsuccessful and short lived.</p>
<p><strong>The International Union of Timberworkers</strong>, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor was chartered in 1913 and managed to survive into 1923. In 1917 a small number of South Asians in BC applied to join.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It wasn’t that South Asians were hesitant to join unions. Unions continued to be unwilling or unable to find ways to organize them. In 1921, New York University Economics lecturer and special agent of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics <strong>Rajani Das</strong> toured British Columbia and observed that <strong>South Asian workers were sympathetic to the labour movement’s goals.</strong></p>

<p>A significant development took place when the IWA leadership hired three organizers to break down the barriers of race and unite workers in the forest industry’s workforce. <strong>Roy Mah,</strong> <strong>Joe Miyazawa</strong> and <strong>Darshan Singh Sangha</strong> all played key roles during the union’s intense organizing drives of the 1940s.</p>
<div>
<p>The son of a poor Punjabi farmer, <strong>Darshan Singh Sangha</strong> — also known as <strong>Darshan Singh ‘Canadian’</strong> — arrived in BC as a 19-year old student at the University of British Columbia in 1937. He joined the Communist Party in 1938 and was introduced through the party to the IWA.</p>

That is the time from which my baptism took place.”  <a aria-label="Footnote 1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-116-1" id="return-footnote-116-1" title="Perry and Pritchett, (1979) in Daudharia (2004), 50."><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a></span></p>

<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;color: #ff0000">“So when I entered the industry, I found generally that most of the white workers were being paid 40 cents an hour. Most of the Indian and Chinese will get much less for the same work. And this was my experience where I found an Indian working for 25 cents an hour or 30 cents an hour, while other workers getting the full 40 cents.<strong> Invariably East Indians were the first to be fired and last to be hired. So furthermore, I found that only rarely was there an East Indian who would get any skilled job.</strong> They would mostly get jobs in the yard. Jobs loading the box cars and jobs on the green chain. The toughest jobs there. Now this had to do with the general situation as it prevailed in the British Columbia community. Racial discrimination was stark. In the first phase they were terribly afraid. Many many people would come over to me. They would say, ‘you are wasting your time’, that this way you will become a marked man.

<p>“It was difficult for Darshan to talk to workers about the union. The biggest problem was that he had nowhere to hold the talks. The workers lived in bunkhouses, which were usually next to the mills, located on the mill owner’s property and it was simply not possible to talk openly there.”</p>
<p>“The meeting places for the Indian communities were the religious centres, the gurdwaras, and the talks couldn’t be held there because the mill owners had a lot of power in the community so the workers had to be contacted secretly. However, as Darshan’s influence spread among workers, he was eventually able to hold large meetings openly.” Sadhu Binning and Sukhwant Hundal, Darshan Singh Canadian: Ten Years in Canada, 1989. <a href="https://digital.lib.sfu.ca/km-6324/darshan-singh-canadian-ten-years-canada">https://digital.lib.sfu.ca/km-6324/darshan-singh-canadian-ten-years-canada</a></p>

<div class="textbox">

<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;color: #ff0000">“The white workers were also learning from their own experience.

<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;color: #ff0000">“<strong>We, the East Indians, were deeply relieved when we saw that the IWA took a very solid and good stand on Indian independence and colonialism.</strong> They stood for independence of lndia and rights of Indian people to fight for it.

<p><strong>Tara Singh Bains</strong> was a well-respected, religious man who came to BC from Punjab in the 1950s. Working at a mill in Nanaimo, Bains experienced anger from white workers who felt South Asians were working too hard, raising expectations of everyone. A white worker further up the chain was deliberately slowing down so that Bains had more work to do. When Bains asked him to stop doing it the worker said <strong><em>“I don’t speak your language”</em></strong>.<a aria-label="Footnote 1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-124-1" id="return-footnote-124-1" title="Hugh Johnston, The Four Quarters of the Night: The Life-Journey of an Emigrant Sikh.

<p>After becoming active in the IWA, Bains was able to convince management to increase the number of workers per shift so the work could be more equally shared. Later, he took on executive positions in the union at a time when South Asians were just beginning to become active union members.</p>
<p><strong>Barriers of language and cultural expectations could make union activism difficult.</strong> Once while on strike, Bains received a phone call from his brother-in-law, who had sponsored his travel and provided him a place to live upon arrival. The call was to tell him they had used their contacts with the labour contractor at a mill in False Creek to get Bains a job away from the strike. When he refused, saying he had taken a pledge to stand with the union his brother-in-law hung up the phone after saying “Well if you are so determined, we don’t want any relations with you.” Over time, they too would change their minds.</p>

<p><strong>“Like the bees around the sweets”</strong></p>
<p><strong>By the 1970s, South Asian Canadian workers had become active members throughout the IWA, participating in labour actions and taking on various leadership roles.</strong></p>

<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff"><strong>Harry Bains</strong> recalled a racist incident which the IWA helped him to stand against. Inspired by the way it was handled, he became involved in the union and was quickly elected to the local executive. He described how South Asian sawmill workers saw the value of representing each other by taking on union positions and bringing those to the forefront. The union encouraged unity, respect and dignity between millworkers. The structure of the IWA was such that most issues were handled on the shop floor through “lunch room meetings”, so local shop stewards and plant committees were significant and powerful roles to hold.</span></p>

<p><strong>In the sawmills, the union advocated for and achieved important contract language that met the specific needs of its South Asian members.</strong> <strong>Sucha Deepak</strong> explains that the IWA successfully negotiated improved leave provisions at the sawmill in Fort St James in northern BC. It allowed South Asian workers, based upon seniority, enough time to travel to India for marriages. <strong>This achievement was later expanded to the collective agreements in all operations around BC.</strong></p>

<p><strong>World War II was a turning point for labour in Canada.</strong></p>
<p>Governments saw the need to avoid the class turmoil sparked by World War I and end their standoffish approach of the Depression. Political expedience required reform. Labour’s decades long demand for federal unemployment insurance was realized in 1940. Universal family allowances were introduced in 1944. <strong>And at long last, after seventy years of struggle, the fight for compulsory recognition of unions and collective bargaining was finally won, first in British Columbia and then across Canada.</strong> In 1943, amendments to BC’s flawed Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act gave the government authority to recognize a union and force employers to bargain.<a aria-label="Footnote 1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-112-1" id="return-footnote-112-1" title="Mickleburgh, On the Line, 106."><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>At the start of World War II the dominant union for lumber workers in BC was the</strong> <strong>International Woodworkers of America (IWA)</strong>. A disastrous strike in 1938 drained the IWA’s resources and its membership numbered just a few hundred. It had no contracts in place and the future seemed bleak.</p>
<p><strong>As a strategy to revive the union, the IWA leadership embraced new organizing strategies to encourage membership and involvement from South Asians, and other ethnic workers</strong>. The fight against fascism created a wartime labour shortage, and the willingness of government to concede union recognition meant organizing took off. South Asian Canadians, reluctant to join the war effort while still denied the vote, were still a significant part of the sawmill workforce.</p>
<p><strong>In early December 1943, District Council No. 1 of the IWA signed its first coast-wide forest agreement, a one-year deal covering eight thousand employees in twenty-three camps and mills.</strong> The agreement recognized the IWA as the bargaining agent for the workers, <strong>ending the reign of labour contractors</strong>. Through this successful collective agreement, the union achieved an 8-hour day and 48-hour week as well as seniority provisions that guaranteed equality of treatment.</p>
<p><strong>By the end of 1946 the IWA was the third-largest union in Canada with more than 25,000 members.</strong> Thousands of South Asians were already employed in the lumber industry. .</p>
<p><strong>These first agreements were also the death knell of discriminatory, racially based wages in sawmills.</strong> This was a major shift;  a generation-spanning dedication to the IWA from South Asian lumber workers took root in this period.</p>
<p>Technological change in the forest industry, which began in the 1970s impacted workers dramatically. Job loss hit the South Asian Canadian workforce hard. It was not until 1979 that the IWA managed to negotiate a joint pension plan that provided income security to workers forced out of the industry.</p>

<p>Gradually, South Asian Canadian women’s work expanded to include other types of informal and seasonal work outside the home.</p>
<p>One example was agricultural work; others found work as kitchen hands or housekeepers. The work was low-paid, low-barrier entry work that required no English language skills. Many didn’t feel the need to learn English since they worked in groups comprised entirely of other non-English speaking immigrants.</p>
<p>Though they often tried not to complain about the work, the adjustment to life in BC was hard for women who performed unpaid labour in their homes as well as work in the informal economy.

<p><strong>In the 1960s and 70s revised immigration laws allowed more South Asian women to enter Canada.</strong> The economy was changing too: jobs were disappearing in resource based industries like forestry. The service economy was growing. Union membership declined among private sector workers but grew in the expanding public sector, which also gained bargaining rights.</p>
<p><strong>Some of these newly arrived South Asian women had marketable skills and education, </strong>often with English language skills and university-level educations – they were able to enter fields such as social work, teaching, nursing, office administration and more.</p>
<p><strong>Still, many women who did not have these advantages </strong>and were limited to low-skilled and low-paid in-service work: in hotel and restaurant kitchens, cleaners and farmworkers.</p>
<p><strong>Working class women’s entry to the paid labour force was often mediated by their roles as mothers and wives.</strong> On occasion it was the male household members who were IWA union members in sawmills and knew the benefits of belonging to a union who encouraged their spouses to join unions as well.</p>
<p><strong>Marie Decaire</strong>, former Secretary-Treasurer of Hotel, Restaurant, Culinary Employees and Bartenders Union Local 40, one of the oldest unions in British Columbia (now known as UNITE HERE! Local 40), estimates that <strong>15% of the membership was South Asian when she was on the executive.</strong> This membership represented workers in virtually every form of hospitality, restaurant and service industry throughout British Columbia and the Yukon. She worked alongside <strong>Rishi Sharma</strong>, an executive member originally from Fiji, who was elected chief shop steward by workers at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Vancouver. <strong>Many Local 40 members were women and new immigrants from the wider South Asian diaspora, and were active in the union.</strong></p>

In any event, I then, of course, went about busily trying to sign check-off cards and all these folk, they were mostly housekeeping kitchen staff and maintenance. And just overall cleaning staff at the hotel.”<br/>
“…Being in a union, being in the IWA and standing up for your rights was the way of Canadian life for them. And and you know, a lot of them had socialist backgrounds. I mean, there was the socialism that came with them. They were renegades in their own country anyway.

<p><strong>For more educated and fluent immigrants it was still a struggle to find work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nina Dhillon</strong> came from England to Coquitlam with her family as a teenager in the early 1980s, and later moved to Quesnel with her husband. After struggling to find a job she returned alone to the Fraser Valley. She spent a year as a farmworker before working in a kitchen at a non-unionized health care facility. Though initially not a union supporter, she eventually helped to organize the union at her work and was subsequently hired by the Hospital Employees Union (HEU) to organize and assist other workers.</p>

<p>Nina defied cultural and societal norms multiple times in her life. Her decision to seek work after marriage was a challenge; even more so to go to Abbotsford alone to find a job. Eventually, her husband joined her, and together they navigated non-traditional gender roles with Nina as the breadwinner and her husband raising their children.</p>

<p><strong>As union members, South Asian women took active roles.</strong> Work was a place where alliances were forged with women and men of other ethnicities which was a powerful tool in achieving better pay and rights.</p>
<p>On April 4, 1981, members of the <strong>Hospital Employees’ Union (HEU)</strong> at Windermere Central Park Lodge, a private long-term care home in Vancouver, went on strike after 21 months of fruitless negotiations for a first contract. Race was an important issue for the mainly Asian and South Asian workers.</p>

<p><strong>South Asian women also worked in fish canneries around BC.</strong> In Prince Rupert South Asian women arrived in the early 1960s, accompanying husbands who worked in the local lumber industry.

<p>Over time, union membership served as an “intercultural mediator”; much like the IWA, the UFAWU reached out to various ethnic communities to build membership and strengthen their bargaining power. However, many South Asian women were unfamiliar with what union membership entailed; one described going to work during a 1967 strike:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="textbox shaded">
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">“When I came to the table, the ladies said the “fish was hot”. I responded by saying, “When I touch the fish it is cold, not hot.” I did not understand what they meant by that saying. Many of us decided to keep working… I was also afraid that I would lose my job.”</span><a aria-label="Footnote 1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-131-1" id="return-footnote-131-1" title="Kamala Elizabeth Nayar.

</blockquote>
<p>Once they became more familiar with union culture, Punjabi women began to participate more, voting for shop stewards and respecting picket lines. However, few were involved in the union themselves, still feeling obligations to their households.</p>
<blockquote>

<p style="line-height: 2.5em"><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: larger;">“UFAWU gave us the feeling of security with the job…I was a member of the union but not involved.

<p style="line-height: 2.5em"><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: larger;">“It is one thing to go to the store to ask for a loaf of bread, but for the union you have to be able to speak about things deeply.

<p><strong>Within the IWA — like many other unions — Ladies Auxiliaries were a formidable force.</strong> The women, whose husbands were IWA members in the mills and camps, bolstered picket lines, staged marches, helped fundraise and solidified support for the union’s demands. In their communities they organized in support of better roads, hospitals, schools and children’s nutrition. <strong>In 1943 the Lake Cowichan IWA Ladies’ Auxiliary collected names on petitions to support enfranchisement for South Asians and spoke out against discrimination in the community.</strong></p>

<p>South Asian women possessed knowledge of the revolutionary past of the community. Rattan Kaur was married to the first Sikh Punjabi born in Canada. Her father-in-law was Balwant Singh, a renowned Ghadrite revolutionary and the first priest of the 2nd Avenue Gurdwara. When interviewed about her family and her life in the 1940s  she turns to the women sitting next to her and says in Punjabi that he came in 1906-1907 and that this was the time of Ghadar. <em>“They do not know all of this, do they?”</em> she asks the others.

<p><strong>If there was a single event that solidified in labour’s mind that right-wing ideology and racism were connected, it was the July 1983 provincial budget in BC.</strong> No less than twenty-six pieces of legislation were tabled, representing a premeditated strike on all those elements of society the newly re-elected Social Credit government had never really liked: social justice, community activists, rights of the disadvantaged and public employees and their unions.</p>

<p><strong>In February 1983, the BC Human Rights Commission published a report that was an historic recognition of systemic legislative racism in government policies. The Commission supported the elimination of all legislation that discriminated against farmworkers. When the Human Rights Branch and the Human Rights Commission were eliminated in July, it was an unthinkable assault on British Columbians.</strong></p>
<p>The response by labour and community groups was sudden and unprecedented. With its distinctive red and white banner, <a href="https://www.labourheritagecentre.ca/vmc"><strong>Operation Solidarity and the Solidarity Coalition</strong></a> were soon household names and galvanizing forces across BC.</p>
<p><strong>Both the Canadian Farmworkers Union and the BC Organization to Fight Racism were active participants in the historic 1983 Solidarity movement in BC.</strong> Pictures of farmworkers during the rallies as well as farmworker union organizers show that there was considerable support from South Asian Canadians for the movement. <strong>Sadhu Binning</strong> took his entire family and his friends to be part of the moment.</p>

<p>The relationship between the Canadian Farmworkers Union and the BC labour movement was strong throughout its history. The Union also exerted influence upon the labour movement by raising issues of systemic racism and forming alliances on issues outside the context of union organizing. The CFU had a profound effect on the direction that BC labour later took as an agent of social change.</p>

<p><strong>Most farmworkers spoke no English. Two-thirds were women.</strong> <strong>New to Canada – and reminiscent of earlier generations of South Asian Canadian workers – they were fearful of their fate if they complained.</strong></p>
<p>The work was seasonal and followed the calendar of agricultural crops. Farmworkers traveled to the Fraser Valley from all parts of British Columbia, including the lower mainland. Those from outside the region lived in crude ramshackle shacks with no running water. Those who lived closer to farms were transported to the fields by contractors or family members. <strong>The women and elderly workers often brought their children as young as 8 years old to work beside them</strong>.</p>

<p>The origins of the Canadian Farmworkers Union can be traced to the Vancouver chapter of the <strong>Indian People’s Association of North America</strong> (IPANA). Its earliest members included <strong>Harinder Mahil</strong>, <strong>Raj Chouhan</strong> and <strong>Chin Banerjee</strong>. These men were already friends who recognized that farmworkers in British Columbia were being exploited. At an IPANA meeting in 1979, Chouhan and Mahil agreed to attempt to organize the farmworkers. Both had personally experienced the working conditions on farms and both had connections to the labour movement.</p>

The strike at Jensen’s began in April 1981.  After many months of maintaining a 24 hour picket line, Jensen completely stopped production and put his farm for sale. “Initially Jensen maintained production as 10 workers scabbed. The line was subjected to various forms of violence from name calling, to car pounding, to a physical scuffle, to telephone wires being cut, to trucks being chased at high speeds, to an attempt to burn down the trailer while a picketer was sleeping inside.” Image Photos-139, <em>Canadian Farmworkers Union Collection</em>, Simon Fraser University Library.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the meantime, tragedy swept the growing fields. <strong>Sukhdeep Madhar, a seven month-old baby, drowned</strong> when she rolled off a small bunkbed into a large bucket of drinking water in the converted horse stall used to accommodate her family. The farm owner had provided no running water.</p>
<p><strong>Barely a week later, three young boys, left to play by themselves while their parents picked berries, drowned</strong> in a nearby abandoned gravel pit. The deaths shocked British Columbians. Decrying the “horror” of living conditions on the farm, a coroner’s inquest into the infant death called for immediate inspections of all agricultural accommodation in the province.</p>
<p><strong>For the families of the three drowned boys, the CFU helped win $30,000 in damages from the gravel-pit owner.</strong> The union pressed forward with demonstrations, public meetings and well researched briefs, backed by a supportive media and public.</p>
<p>With no comprehensive regulations or mandatory training in place,<strong> nineteen-year-old farm worker Jarnail Singh Deol died of pesticide poisoning</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>When a coroner’s jury ruled the death of Deol was ‘preventable homocide’ and said the government was partly responsible, the Social Credit government announced WCB coverage would be extended to agricultural workers effective April 4, 1983. They reneged on that commitment just before that spring’s election campaign.</strong> Raj Chouhan lambasted the turnabout as the government’s “most dishonest betrayal.”</p>
<p>Farmworkers would have to wait until 1993 before they were brought under the same health and safety umbrella as other BC workers.</p>

<p><strong>In another groundbreaking organizational strategy, the Canadian Farmworkers’ Union incorporated revolutionary artistic work by writing and staging their own plays, Bhangra dance performances, and more.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paul Binning</strong> was an activist who helped connect arts, culture and labour activism. He was one of the first professional Bhangra dancers in BC, teaching many Canadian-born youth through his Richmond based dance troupe, the <strong>Punjab Cultural Association</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Bhangra</em> originated as an amalgamation of folk dances from various regions in the Punjab, coming together in the revolutionary era of the 1940s and continuing to evolve in years since. Song lyrics often include themes of love, patriotism, strength and celebration during times of harvest, which resonated strongly with BC farmworkers. Many of the traditional dance moves represent farming activities: for example, the “pick and place” action of harvesting or moving crop.</p>
<p><strong>The Binning family was involved with the CFU from the beginning</strong>, and it wasn’t long before Paul was in charge of organizing entertainment for the union’s frequent fundraising dinners. Despite its strong historic working-class associations, not everyone in the community appreciated Bhangra’s role as a labour organizing tool. He defended what he called “<em>revolutionary Bhangra</em>”:</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="281" id="oembed-1" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/644094852?h=13fb0066fb&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" title="Revolutionary Bhangra - Paul Binning" width="500"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Music and dance also bridged the gap between communities.</strong> This was often the case with the CFU, who used Bhangra performances to introduce a part of Sikh Punjabi culture to fellow trade unionists. It was at a cultural show in New Westminster hosted at one of the trade union halls that the two became really connected.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="textbox shaded">
<p style="line-height: 2.5em"><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: larger;">“After that, I became very, very much involved… my Bhangra, with the kids, that I was doing with the kids became their first, main entertainment, to get the people together – then they could make their speeches. A lot of people came to see us, they came to hear our dhol [drum] … there’s something that was Punjabi, something that belonged to them. They wanted to see that, feel that.”</span></span><a aria-label="Footnote 1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-142-1" id="return-footnote-142-1" title="Paul Binning, interview by Anushay Malik, May 7, 2021.Union Zindabad!

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Discrimination was a frequent issue in the 1980s, and racial tensions did not go away during performances.</strong> Binning recalled an incident where his <em>Bhangra</em> performers faced repeated hostility from a local crowd in Fort St. James which evolved to connection and celebration once they had a chance to experience the dance.</p>

<p><strong>Farmworkers tried their hand at playwriting</strong>; they performed short comedic skits at their first convention, poking fun at aggressive anti-union farm owners and exploring more serious issues such as workplace safety. The <strong>BC Federation of Labour</strong> helped to sponsor a 1985 “<em>CFU Cultural Programme</em>” at Yale Jr. Secondary School in Abbotsford, which featured speeches, Bhangra, and a performance of <strong><em>“Picket Line”</em></strong> alongside another play titled <em><strong>“Jageeru Lumber”</strong></em>. <strong>Sadhu Binning</strong>, brother of <strong>Paul Binning</strong> and <strong>Vancouver Sath</strong> co-founder, helped to write the play and reflected in an oral history interview:</p>

<p><strong>The exhausting slog and minimal advances eventually wore down the union’s leaders.</strong> They left to take other jobs, and the Canadian Farmworkers’ Union began to fade. Yet there was a strong sense its success could not be measured solely in union certifications.</p>
<p><strong>It was clear to organizers that the path forward was via political change.</strong> When the NDP formed government in BC in 1991, <strong>Moe Sihota</strong> — the first South Asian to be elected to federal or provincial office in Canada — <strong>became Minister of Labour</strong>.  The minimum wage rose to $7 an hour, the highest in the country, and working conditions were enhanced with a new Employment Standards Act.</p>
<p><strong>For the first time, farmworkers, live-in nannies, taxi drivers, artists, security guards, fishermen and newspaper carriers were brought under the legislation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In 1996, the NDP went further, setting up a hands-on Agricultural Compliance Team (ACT).</strong> With representatives from Employment Standards, the WCB, the Motor Vehicle Branch and federal agencies, ACT took a proactive approach to inspections and enforcement, providing the best protection BC farmworkers had ever had. <strong>Changes and standards that unions had sought for years were now in place, and labour’s voice was heard at the cabinet table.</strong></p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="281" id="oembed-1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uCHumxkiNII?feature=oembed&amp;rel=0" title="The History of Health and Safety in B.C.'s Farmworker Industry" width="500"></iframe></p>
<p>Workplace safety, poorly treated farmworkers, child labour laws, abuse of temporary foreign workers—these were all matters pursued by unions away from the bargaining table, often at great expense. This goes to the heart of the labour movement’s existence as agents of social change, beyond issues of dollars and cents.</p>

<p><strong>The 1940s were an historic period for BC labour when huge increases in union membership and unprecedented improvements in working conditions took place. The International Woodworkers of America (IWA) led the way in organizing lumber workers, regardless of ethnicity or gender.  The creation of the Canadian Farmworkers Union in the 1980s was another watershed for South Asian Canadian labour.</strong></p>
<p>Abysmal working conditions prevailed on many farms in the Fraser Valley in the 1960s and 70s. Thousands of farmworkers – mostly South Asian immigrants – toiled long hours in the summer heat, under the heel of labour contractors who skimmed their low wages and owners who relegated them to appalling living quarters.</p>
<p>Young immigrant <strong>Raj Chouhan</strong> was shocked by what he found when he sought work.<em> “There was no running water, no toilets, absolutely no facilities,”</em> Chouhan told a  reporter years later. Employees often lived in converted barns, six to a cubicle, their kids among them. <em>“I was expecting, in a country like Canada, there would be something better </em><em>than that,”</em> said Chouhan. When he asked questions, he was fired, and the young immigrant had a cause.</p>
<p>Stretching into the 1980s, along with organizers <strong>Sarwan Boal, Judy Cavanagh, Charan Gill</strong> and the IWA’s <strong>Harinder Mahil</strong>, aided by scores of volunteers and supporters, Chouhan led a valiant effort to organize Fraser Valley farm workers, publicize their plight and secure decent working conditions. Employers were supported by the Social Credit government, excluded from regulations and labour standards covering other BC workers.</p>
<p>Despite coercion and violence, the Canadian Farmworkers Union persevered, winning union certifications and shining a spotlight on the dark corner where farmworkers had been shunted by government and an unaware public.</p>

<p><strong>The industrial changes in British Columbia that began in the 1970s pushed many South Asian Canadians out of the lumber industry. </strong>Many of these displaced workers, along with newly arrived immigrants, joined the growing transportation industry, becoming owner-operators of their own long-haul trucks or taxi cabs.</p>
<p><strong>Many felt this entrepreneurial work provided independence, but also it also presented opportunities for exploitation.</strong> The traditional trade union model of “shop-floor organizing” did not seem to be an option for these workers.</p>
<p><strong>The taxi industry was an example where racism and the organization of work intersected</strong>. <strong>Harinder Mahil</strong> recalls an incident in 1980 at Yellow Cabs where the <strong>BC Organization to Fight Racism</strong> became involved.</p>

One of the [taxi] companies didn’t want Indo-Canadians to be shareholders. Basically they were selling shares in the company. You were buying a job for yourself. You’re putting out a whole bunch of money so you could own a taxi and you could drive it. Putting the two issues together taxi drivers contacted us to help them. And we did. Highlighting this issue, educating the public that this is going on. And once it becomes public and it’s out in the media and then the company would shy away from discriminating because then, you know, people will say, you know, that’s the company that doesn’t allow Indo-Canadian shareholders, that’s the company that doesn’t allow Indo-Canadians to be a driver.

<p><strong>The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) has long been a militant union in British Columbia, with a strong dedication to international solidarity and preserving their own labour history. </strong></p>
<p>1946 was a significant year to the ILWU, much like the in IWA. It was the year that they were among multiple unions who came together at a San Francisco convention to consider “one big union” for all maritime and waterfront workers. The campaign was a success. At the same time, they kept an eye on international events, with the union’s international newspaper <em>The Dispatcher</em> reporting headlines like: <em>“Starvation threatens six million Indians”</em>, and a full-page article on the conditions for longshoremen in India.</p>
<p>With a global economy increasingly dependent on shipping, longshore workers have wielded their collective power by taking actions such as <strong>refusing to load ships to Nazi Germany or apartheid-era South Africa</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>It was just before this period that we see South Asian labour appear on the Fraser River waterfront.</strong>  <strong>Jack Singh</strong> was believed to be the first South Asian longshoreman in ILWU Local 502 (New Westminster). He was hired on in 1958; “Jack” didn’t recall a whole lot of trouble for being the first “East Indian” in the local. He talks about the increase of diversity he saw on the waterfront over his career.</p>
<p>He worked the “green chain” at Fraser Mills for several years before moving on to longshore work. He lied about his age to get a job at the mill, supposedly starting at age 14, and took the night shift because it paid 72 cents per hour — 5 cents more than day shift. He retired in 1995. <a aria-label="Footnote 1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-156-1" id="return-footnote-156-1" title="Jack Singh, interview by Dean Johnson, 2013, (Re)Claiming the New Westminster Waterfront fonds, New Westminster Archives, http://archives.newwestcity.ca/permalink/69097/."><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a></p>
<p>According to past ILWU Canada President <strong>Tom Dufresne</strong>, there was a surge in hiring South Asian members around the years 1971-72, which tailed off as the longshore industry experienced a downturn around 1974.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="textbox shaded">
<p style="line-height: 2.5em"><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: larger;">“There have been South Asian workers in ILWU for many years, in Local 500 and 502 mainly.

Precarious employment. 1971-72 Canada embarked on a World Food Program supplying sacked malt to Bangladesh; the grain arrived in sacks in railcars or in bulk box cars and was sacked on the Coast. Throughout history, newly arrived immigrants would gravitate to day work to pay the bills.

<p><strong>Sewak Singh Dhaliwal</strong> was born in Canada. His father <strong>Giani Harnam Singh</strong> was one of the first 100 South Asians to immigrate to BC in 1906. <strong>Dhaliwal was the first South Asian member of the Teamsters Union in BC when he joined in 1960. He estimates the sector is now 90% South Asian</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Local 213 of the Teamsters Union</strong> was innovative in dealing with the growing numbers of owner-operators in the trucking industry who did not fit into the traditional definition of “employees” to enjoy the benefits of collective bargaining as union members.</p>
<p>A longtime advocate for road safety and owner of a large aggregate hauling company, Dhaliwal helped the Teamsters Union in BC establish a rate scale for union owner/operators.</p>
<p><strong>The pay scale agreement between construction companies, brokers, truckers was the first of its kind in the aggregate hauling industry. It is still being used today.</strong></p>
<p>Despite the challenge of being independent contractors, truckers in BC took collective action and improve their working conditions. One example was a 1973 campaign which included a convoy of trucks from Abbotsford to Surrey to protest trucking companies practices of “whipsawing” to drive freight prices down.</p>

<p>As South Asian Canadians became more politicized, took up positions in unions, and became more vocal about their rights as Canadians within the labour movement, they also began to move directly into politics. Jinny Sims, Raj Chouhan, Harry Bains and Moe Sihota are just four of the examples of prominent South Asians who were pillars of the South Asian Canadian community, and for the first three of them, it was directly their work within the labour movement that helped launch their political careers, thus allowing them to continue to work to build a more progressive, more inclusive BC.</p>
<p>The problem of racism and exclusion continues into the present day, in workplaces and even within unions.</p>
<p>The relationship of South Asian Canadians to the labour movement shows that unions can be an important partner to help build solidarities between the diverse working classes of British Columbia for their mutual strength and benefit.</p>
